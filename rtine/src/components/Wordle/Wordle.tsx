        Welcome to my Wordle Project, a fun and interactive take on the popular
        word-guessing game! ðŸŽ¯ The goal of this project is to replicate and
        enhance the classic Wordle experience while exploring modern web
        development technologies. This project serves as a playground for
        experimenting with React, state management, and UI design to create a
        smooth and engaging gameplay experience.
